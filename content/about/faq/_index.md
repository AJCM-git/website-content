# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is It Cursed?

A: Nah.

### Q: What Language/Engine is SS14 written in?

A: It's written in C# using a hand made engine. C# is a good language and it's pretty much perfect for the project. It's quite fast but also very comfortable to write.

### Q: Can I Help?

A: Sure you can. Hop on Discord or IRC and look at GitHub. We can use any help we can get!

### Q: Will SS14 Support Multiple Codebases?

A: It already does!

### Q: hdisry?

A: No.

### Q: Is There a Patreon? Can I donate?

A: No. We have no methods of donating to the project at this time. We don't think it'd help to speed up development. While a system like bounties *might* be nice to encourage contribution, it's also a hassle and a potential source of drama.

### Q: Will SS14 Go On Steam?

A: Yes! We're actively working on getting the store page ready for publishing. It'll obviously be free on steam too.
