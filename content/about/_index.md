# What is Space Station 14?

**Space Station 14** (SS14 for short) is a community driven project to get the open source game [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/) into a new engine and free from its current engine, [BYOND](https://secure.byond.com/). BYOND is an incredibly dated engine, and is not cutting it. It's a pain to develop for, slow, proprietary, and looks like it's from 2005. <!-- TODO: Verify how accurate this number is. --> Along with this we will try to make the game more enjoyable all around, such as pixel movement and a consistent style.

Originally, the SS14 project was a continuation of [Goonstation](https://forum.ss13.co/)'s remake attempt, which was abandoned and [open sourced on 19 of January, 2015](https://archive.fo/xey2L). We'll bite the bullet: due to poor project management, SS14 originally died after a month or two. But fear not! **We're back!**

## Status

Currently, the project is in a "pre-alpha" state. We have many tasks ahead of us. On this website you will be able to find progress reports as long as we're kicking.

## Getting involved

Rome was not built in a day, and neither was SS14. We can always use extra hands! The entire project is open source and available on GitHub here:

* Main Repo: [space-wizards/space-station-14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).
* Engine: [space-wizards/RobustToolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).

We primarily communicate through Discord, although there is an IRC channel that's connected to Discord with a bot.

* [Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/t2jac3p)
* IRC: `irc.rizon.net#spacebus`

We also have some other project services set up:
